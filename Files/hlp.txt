There is no such complicacy in the program. It is very simple and straightforward.
1.	To run the program, user is required to run the Elementopedia.py file

2.	In Order to prevent any errors all the png files, txt files, xlsx files and py 
	file should be in one single folder.

3.	Help w.r.t to each program : 

	>	For the first part of the program, Know About the Element, user is required to 
	enter either the Atomic Number or Atomic Symbol of any Element in the periodic table.
	For example:
	10 refers to Neon and thus all its corresponding information as given in 
	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
	Ar refers to Argon and thus all its corresponding information as given in 
	https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

	>	Sorting of Elements, here user is required to select the trend from the four 
	trends available and the order of the sorting. A field is provided to enter the 
	Atomic Symbol of the Element (space separated). Finally press the SHOW button to get 
	the arranged order of the elements.

	>	Identification of Elements in a Compound, here the user is only required to enter 
	the compound and the corresponding elements associated with that compound will be 
	displayed, as simple as that.

	>	Stoichiometric Concentration Terms Converter, here the user is required to choose 
	the conversion as required from the available list (normality, molarity, molality) 
	then enter the values in their SI units and the converted values will be displayed 
	accordingly.

4.	The Home Button is also available in every page, in case the user wants to return back to 
	the home page of Elementopedia. The Menu Button is also given in every page after the 
	menu page to return back to the menu page as and when required.
